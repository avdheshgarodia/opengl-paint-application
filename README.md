# opengl-paint-application
Simple paint application using GLUT and OPENGL
Lot of features need to be added and will keep on adding as I come up with them. If this grows bigger I will move this over to the QT framework. As of right now its just a project for fun. THis project uses the lodepng libray to handle loading and saving png images.

###Things that I want to add
  *Image Convolution
  *Filters such as Gaussian Blur
  *Support for different types of brushes 
  *Image Transformations
